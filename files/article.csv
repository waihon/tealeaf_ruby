7 Remarkable Lessons from Messenger's Mission to Mercury (Discover Magazine),http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/science/434358515?client_source=api&format=json,"Through most of its life, NASA's scrappy Messenger probe was something of a
unsung hero. The first spacecraft ever to orbit Mercury didn't have the you-
are-there appeal of a Mars rover, the daredevil appeal of landing on a comet,
or the romance of visiting a beautiful ringed planet. But with today's death--
the result of a long-anticipated crash into the planet it studied--we can
clearly see what an incredibly successful explorer Messenger was. Mercury has
long been a solar-system enigma.

American Psychological Association Hit With New Torture Allegations,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/Z07NIdAGZxE/american-psychological-association-hit-with-new-torture-allegations,"sciencehabit writes: Did the American Psychological Association (APA) collude with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to enable the torture of detainees in the War on Terror? The answer won't be known until June, when an independent investigation is due to conclude. But at least one thing was made clear in a report from an independent group of psychologists based on e-mail exchanges between APA and CIA officials from 2003 to 2006: The world's largest professional organization for psychologists has maintained a surprisingly cozy relationship with the defense and intelligence community.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Yet each of these work differently, and there are a lot of nuances, so we talked to Todd Brix, general manager of Windows apps and store, to get some more detail. First and foremost, upon Windows 10's launch, developers will only be able to bring Web apps to the Windows Store. The Win32, Android, and iOS app toolkits will not be ready in time. That said, with Microsoft's Windows as a service strategy, they will arrive as part of later updates<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Climatologist Speaks On the Effects of Geoengineering,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/E3e_u_TvTwA/climatologist-speaks-on-the-effects-of-geoengineering,"Lasrick writes: In this interview with Rutgers University climatologist Alan Robock, he discusses geoengineering and nuclear winter. Robock believes that geoengineering is not the solution to global warming because of its many risks and unknowns. He notes that some of the technology that would be required to implement geoengineering has not been developed and that many socio-political questions would have to be resolved before it could be put into practice. To start with, the world would have to reach agreement on a target temperature and on what entity should do the implementing. Robock's biggest fear with regard to geoengineering is that disputes over these questions could escalate into nuclear war which in turn could cause nuclear winter, producing global famine among other effects. Fascinating, wide-ranging interview with one of the world's top climatologists.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

This is a snapshot of Debian ""sid"" at the time of the stable Debian ""jessie"" release (April 2015), so it is mostly based on the same sources. It is not an official Debian release, but it is an official Debian GNU/Hurd port release. The installation ISO images can be downloaded from Debian Ports in the usual three Debian flavors: NETINST, CD, or DVD. Besides the friendly Debian installer, a pre-installed disk image is also available there, making it even easier to try Debian GNU/Hurd.

Game:ref's Hardware Solution To Cheating In eSports,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/RMLD7V0F9BI/gamerefs-hardware-solution-to-cheating-in-esports,"An anonymous reader writes: Cheating is a real problem in today's most popular online multiplayer games, and not just on public servers. Some of the world's top Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have been banned by Valve's Anti-Cheat System (VACS) in recent months too, bringing a nascent eSport into disrepute. But one gamer is taking a different approach, creating a hardware solution called Game:ref to tackle the problem. Simple in design &mdash; Game:ref, which the creator hopes to fund on Kickstarter soon, compares on screen movement with your inputs &mdash; but powerful in potential, the device has the potential to catch out illegal macro users both on and offline. It's already attracting interest in the top flight too.

New Test Supports NASA's Controversial EM Drive,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/Lr92vCn_Yt4/new-test-supports-nasas-controversial-em-drive,"An anonymous reader writes: Last year, NASA's advanced propulsion research wing made headlines by announcing the successful test of a physics-defying electromagnetic drive, or EM drive. Now, this futuristic engine, which could in theory propel objects to near-relativistic speeds, has been shown to work inside a space-like vacuum. NASA Eagleworks made the announcement quite unassumingly via NASASpaceFlight.com. The EM drive is controversial in that it appears to violate conventional physics and the law of conservation of momentum; the engine, invented by British scientist Roger Sawyer, converts electric power to thrust without the need for any propellant by bouncing microwaves within a closed container. So, with no expulsion of propellant, there&rsquo;s nothing to balance the change in the spacecraft&rsquo;s momentum during acceleration.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

This week's patent and follow-up patent cover the futuristic innovative idea that when you order something, you can update your order and add additional amounts to your order while it's being processed. But wait, it gets even more innovative! You may one day be able to even to notify when you would like it delivered &mdash; on your phone! I know, you're busy wiping all that brain matter off your screen as your head seems to have exploded. Well, it turns out that inventor and patent holder Scott Horstemeyer (aka Eclipse IP, LLC of Delray Beach, FL) found no shortage of targets to go after with his new patents. It appears Tiger Fitness (and every other online retailer) was sending notices to customers about shipments. Did I mention Horstemeyer is a lawyer too? But not just a regular lawyer, a ""SUPER lawyer"" from the same firm that patented social networking in 2007, sued Uber for using location finding technologies in 2013 and sued Overstock.com as well as a small time shoe seller for using shipping notifications in 2014.
A related article at Vox makes this case: ""The primary problem with the patent system is, well, the patent system. The system makes it too easy to get broad, vague patents, and the litigation process is tilted too far toward plaintiffs. But because so many big companies make so much money off of this system, few in Congress are willing to consider broader reforms.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Scientists Have Paper On Gender Bias Rejected Because They're Both Women,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/0sRh1eBUiQY/scientists-have-paper-on-gender-bias-rejected-because-theyre-both-women,"ferrisoxide.com writes: A paper co-authored by researcher fellow Dr. Fiona Ingleby and evolutionary biologist Dr. Megan Head &mdash; on how gender differences affect the experiences that PhD students have when moving into post-doctoral work &mdash; was rejected by peer-reviewed PLoS Onebecause they didn't ask a man for help.
 
A (male) peer reviewer for the journal suggested that the scientists find male co-authors, to prevent ""ideologically biased assumptions."" The same reviewer also provided his own ironically biased advice, when explaining that women may have fewer articles published because men's papers ""are indeed of a better quality, on average,"" ""just as, on average, male doctoral students can probably run a mile race a bit faster.""
PLoS One has apologized, saying, ""We have formally removed the review from the record, and have sent the manuscript out to a new editor for re-review.

Seafloor Sensors Record Possible Eruption of Underwater Volcano,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/Pd685R1wQNI/seafloor-sensors-record-possible-eruption-of-underwater-volcano,"vinces99 writes: Thanks to high-tech instruments installed last summer by the University of Washington to bring the deep sea online, what appears to be an eruption of Axial Volcano on April 23 was observed in real time by scientists on shore. ""It was an astonishing experience to see the changes taking place 300 miles away with no one anywhere nearby, and the data flowed back to land at the speed of light through the fiber-optic cable ... in milliseconds,"" said John Delaney, a UW professor of oceanography who led the installation of the instruments as part of a larger effort sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Delaney organized a workshop on campus in mid-April at which marine scientists discussed how this high-tech observatory would support their science. Then, just before midnight on April 23 until about noon the next day, the seismic activity went off the charts. The gradually increasing rumblings of the mountain were documented over recent weeks by William Wilcock, a UW marine geophysicist who studies such systems. During last week's event, the earthquakes increased from hundreds per day to thousands, and the center of the volcanic crater dropped by about 6 feet in 12 hours. ""The only way that could have happened was to have the magma move from beneath the caldera to some other location,"" Delaney said.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Want 30 Job Offers a Month? It's Not As Great As You Think,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/ndeDuzo0YAw/want-30-job-offers-a-month-its-not-as-great-as-you-think,"An anonymous reader writes: Software engineers suffer from a problem that most other industries wish they had: too much demand. There's a great story at the Atlantic entitled Imagine Getting 30 Job Offers a Month (It Isn't as Awesome as You Might Think). This is a problem that many engineers deal with: place your resume on a job board and proceed to be spammed multiple times per day for jobs in places that you would never go to (URGENT REQUIREMENT IN DETROIT!!!!!, etc). Google ""recruiter spam"" and there are many tales of engineers being overwhelmed by this. One engineer, fed up by a lack of a recruiting spam blackhole, set up NoRecruitingSpam.com with directions on how to stop this modern tech scourge.

Have you been the victim of recruiting spam?<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

the surface* of the Sun, broke off and created an enormous snakelike eruption
of plasma that extended millions of miles out into space. The event was both

activity of our home star…and it […]
